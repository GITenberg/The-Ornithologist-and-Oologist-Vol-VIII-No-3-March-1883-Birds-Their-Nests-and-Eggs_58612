<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Among the Buteos.</span></h2>
<p>The voices of our New England Buzzards
are again ringing through their
old haunts, and it may now be seasonable
to review my local notes on
their breeding habits last Spring. In
short, then, I took 104 eggs. And from
other nests in my circle of observation
were taken or destroyed by farmers, hawk-hunters
and others, sixty more eggs and
young birds. So until a more favored
breeding range is made known I shall
claim this to be the home of the Buteos.
A correspondent in Rochester writes that
he thinks as many eggs can be taken yearly
in that vicinity, but until this is shown to
be true I shall not believe the distribution
of species is so equal. If this article could
be accompanied by a good physical map of
Norwich and its environs, it would help
greatly to support my claims. An irregular
line drawn around the city just outside
the suburbs would pass through the breeding
places of sixteen pairs of Red-shouldered
Hawks which I marked down the second
week in April. Except a few hemlocks,
the groves and strips of first growth
are all deciduous and nearly all nut-bearing.
The red squirrel, which is not so relentlessly
shot down as his gray cousin, is
amazingly plenty in these suburban woods.
While skating yesterday on Yantic cove,
within the city limits, I saw seven squirrels
playing in the small patch above Christ&rsquo;s
church on the river bank. Every one who
has climbed to nests of young Buteos
nearly fledged, must have been astonished
at the great quantity of these young
rodents, supplied by the parent birds. In
one nest of Red-tailed Hawks I have seen
portions of nine red squirrels, and from
another have counted out on the ground
seven entire bodies. A game bird or chicken
now and then, but red squirrels for
every day bill-of-fare. Mousing, Master
Buteo will go. And frogging, too, for I
have several times surprised him in muddy
sloughs in the woods, and field collectors
often are called to notice the black mud on
fresh Hawk&rsquo;s eggs. Given then a great
food supply and the species that follow it
will be abundant. Over the grove of second
growths to the left of Love Lane,
last Spring, I saw a pair of Red-shouldered
Hawks hovering for days in succession.
I knew they were not breeding in
the patch, as they had not done so in
former years, and there were but three old
Crow&rsquo;s nests very low down. But to be
very sure I examined the grove repeatedly
with care and found it to be alive with red
squirrels. In one apple-tree hole was a
litter of six; in the butt of an oak were
five with eyes unopened, and the conspicuous
outside nests were many. A Barred
Owl clung to the top of a white birch with
one claw, and was tearing away at a squirrel&rsquo;s
new domed nest with the other claw.
The Hawks had their nest with two young
in the swamp beyond, and this grove was
their handy larder, and very noisy they
were over their daily grace before meat.</p>
<p>The Buteos&rsquo; nests from which my &rsquo;82
series was taken, were for the most part
old ones, the very few exceptions being
smaller than those used for several seasons.
The use of an old nest by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
Great-horned Owl is habitual. The Barred
Owl takes a hole when it can find one,
and if not, an old nest. Failing there, he
builds a very small nest of the flimsiest
sort. To show the dislike of our Raptores
to nidification, let me reproduce an avian
drama to which usher nature gave me a
free pass and open stall last Spring. The
scene opens late in March on Plain Hill,
where a pair of Red-shouldered Hawks
were furbishing up the nest in which off
and on they had bred for five years. Their
dalliance was pleasant, no doubt, but dangerously
long, for a Barred Owl slipped in
and laid two eggs April 1 and 3. The
Hawks were virtually indignant, and were
often seen to dash down towards the nest,
as if to dispossess the intruder, but they
always wisely stopped a few inches above
the snapping bill and mass of fluffy feathers
with nine points of law in its favor.
The Hawks at length went across a small
swamp and re-upholstered the nest in
which the Owl bred in &rsquo;81. I now took
the two Owl&rsquo;s eggs, supposing the clutch
complete, but she then went across the
swamp and laid the third egg in her old
tenement. When I climbed to the second
nest, with the Hawks in possession, it contained
three Buteo&rsquo;s eggs and one Barred
Owl&rsquo;s. Blowing showed that the Owl&rsquo;s
egg was slightly incubated, and it would
have been interesting perhaps to have let
nature had her course with this motley
clutch. The unwearied owl now went
back to the first nest and laid and hatched
her second clutch of two eggs. Ovipositing
after a while again becoming a necessity
for the Hawks, they too repaired to
the opening scene of our drama from
high life, and after a few noisy demonstrations
against the Owl, took up their new
quarters in a tree within gunshot of the
first. The nest was so small I could not
believe that even our smallest Buteo (<i>pennsylvanicus</i>),
could breed in it, though I saw
the great female Red-shouldered come from
it, and could see that it was feathered
through my field glass. Climbing showed
it to have a very large and bright initial
egg, which was riddled with shot the next
day by so-called hawk-hunters. The marauders
completed the series of reprisals
by carrying away my young owls.</p>
<p>Aside from my first object, I have dwelt
on the final details of this little tragedy,
because it also is a fair illustration of the
domestic troubles of the Rapaci&aelig; here in
the breeding season. With every man&rsquo;s
hand against them&mdash;hunter, farmer and
collector&mdash;it is a continued source of wonder
that so many eggs are taken and so
many hawks left. Some may be alien birds
drawn by the food supply. But as a solution
to this question it is not unreasonable
to suppose that later in the season when
the farmers are busy with field work and
the collector is eagerly following the small
birds in their Summer homes in the outskirts
of the woods, that made wary by
pursuit, and screened by the dense foliage,
the resident Buteos manage to &ldquo;steal&rdquo; an
occasional nest and bring up enough young
to keep up the old local race. This idea
is in part born out by the fact that in my
Winter tramps through our leafless woods,
I now and then run across a Hawk&rsquo;s nest
which I knew was not there the year before
and the first chapter of whose life history
had not been revealed to me.&mdash;<i>J. M. W.,

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Notes from Nebraska.</span></h2>
<p>April 21, &rsquo;82, found my first nest of the
American Long Eared Owl. &rsquo;Twas in the
forks of a small white oak tree fifteen feet
from the ground and contained five eggs
ready to hatch. It resembled that of the
Common Crow, only smaller. While I was
examining this nest the old birds showed
their displeasure by flying and darting
close to me, continually snapping the bill.</p>
<p>At times they would alight upon the
ground and with spread wings and tail
flutter around, doubtless for the purpose
of alluring the intruder from their nest.
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
The same day I found the nest of a Black
Cap Chickadee containing six fresh eggs.</p>
<p>April 23d I found the nest of a Screech
Owl in a hollow oak tree twenty inches below
the opening. It contained three fresh
eggs. From this same tree during the
Winter of 1881 and &rsquo;82 I captured five fine
specimens of this owl.</p>
<p>May 1st I took another set of eggs of
the American Long-eared Owl. This, like
the former, contained five eggs and they
were incubated about two weeks. Another
nest was found on May 4th with five eggs
almost hatched.</p>
<p>May 6th I discovered the nest of a Red-tailed
Hawk in a Red Elm tree fifty-eight
feet from the ground. After a very hard
climb I found the nest contained four (?)
young about two weeks old. On the 13th
of May I found two more nests of this
hawk, both of which contained eggs; one
two, and the other three.</p>
<p>May 18th I was informed by a herder or
&ldquo;Cow Boy&rdquo; that he had found a burrow
on the prairie inhabited by a Burrowing
Owl. The next evening armed with a spade
we repaired to the place and after digging
six feet we came upon the nest. It was
about two feet under the ground and contained
nine young of various sizes, and two
eggs, one of which was pecked. The burrow
was evidently made by some burrowing
animal, probably a skunk.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk.</span>&mdash;The following is the
date of different nests found this year:
May 11th, one nest containing four fresh
eggs. May 15th, one containing four and
another containing five eggs, all of which
were fresh. May 17th, two more nests containing
five eggs each. These were slightly
incubated. May 11th I received a full set
of eggs of the Marsh Harrier, five in number.
The nest was placed on the ground
in the prairie grass. Two more nests were
found, May 18th, containing respectively
five and six eggs. These last were slightly
incubated. May 17th I also found a nest of
the Short-eared Owl. It was on the
ground in the prairie grass and contained
eight beautiful white eggs. A good Pointer
dog is invaluable to any one collecting eggs
here, as these Owls and Hawks give chase
whenever he comes near their nest. The
dog will come very handy also to find the
nests of Prairie Hens, Plover, Larks, &amp;c.&mdash;<i>H.
A. Kline, Polo, Ill.</i></p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">The Prothonotary Warbler.</span></h2>
<p>This beautiful little <i>Protonotaria citrea</i>
is quite rare in Kansas, yet I had the
good fortune to find four nests last June.</p>
<p>Early in May I saw a Downy Woodpecker
making an excavation in the dead
limb of a small elm tree standing on the
edge of a forest and on the bank of the
Big Blue River. I watched the tree for
several days, but, for some cause, the birds
abandoned the work.</p>
<p>On June 9, in passing this tree I saw a
bird fly from the hole so swiftly that I could
not determine the species. I hid in some
bushes near by, and after waiting about
ten minutes was rewarded by seeing a pair
of the Prothonotary Warblers approach
through the trees. They flew directly to
the elm tree; and, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
the female entered the hole, while
the male flew away into the forest.</p>
<p>I then crept silently to the nest, which
was not more than six feet above the
ground. By quickly placing my hand over
the hole and allowing sufficient opening
between my thumb and finger for the admission
of the bird&rsquo;s head but not its body,
I easily caught the bird and examined it
at my leisure. I have frequently caught
Woodpeckers, Bluebirds, Chickadees and
Wrens in this manner.</p>
<p>When the bird was released it uttered a
short, distinct call which brought the male
bird promptly from the trees near by. They
then flew away together.</p>
<p>Returning to the tree I secured the nest
and complement of five fresh eggs.</p>
<p>This nest was composed of fine grapevine
bark, dry weeds, and horse hair. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
structure was rather frail and deeply
rounded. Around its upper edge were arrayed
bits of skeleton oak leaves whose
delicate lace-like tracery of veinlets gave
evidence of greater taste than I had before
seen in bird architecture.</p>
<p>The eggs were much rounded in shape.
The color was white with a pinkish hue,
and dotted with spots of brown and lavender.
At the larger end these spots were
so thick as to become confluent. The eggs
were similar in size and markings.</p>
<p>Two more nests of this bird were reported
to me on the same date, June 9.
Upon visiting them I found in one five
young nearly fledged, and in the other two
addled eggs.</p>
<p>A week or more after the discovery of
the first nest I found a pair of the birds
not far from the same place. I watched
them closely and afterward frequently saw
the male alone, but failed to find the nest
until after the young had left it, when
I found it in the deserted nest of a Bluebird
not a hundred feet away from a dwelling
house.</p>
<p>I identified the nest by its peculiar architecture
and a few egg shells at the base
of the tree.</p>
<p>These four nests were alike in situation,
all being in damp forests near the river,
and in deserted nests of other birds, about
six or seven feet above the ground. They
were all built of like material and were
ornamented with skeleton leaves. Two of
the nests were in elm trees and two in willow
stumps. I have read no description of
the nest of this warbler and do not know
whether the above agrees with the experience
of older observers.&mdash;<i>D. E. Lantz,

<p>Of five nests of the Ground Robin found
by me last Spring only two were on the
ground. One was six feet above ground
in a greenbrier (<i>Smilax.</i>)</p>
<p>Last Spring the Harris Sparrow remained
with us until the latter part of May. During
May I found in nests of other birds
several parasitic eggs which did not resemble
those of the Cowbird in shape, size
or color. They were much smaller, elongated
in shape, and the markings were
lighter. I found many Cowbirds&rsquo; eggs
later but none like these. The query presented
itself whether the Harris Sparrow
could have laid these.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Clark on &ldquo;Gull Island.&rdquo;</span>&mdash;This young
Tern was about two-thirds grown, without
feathers, only sprouting quills, and was
covered with thick gray down, and the
fish, a Herring, was fully as long as the
bird, and very nearly as heavy, and was
about half swallowed. They lay on the
ground, the bird flat on its side, and I supposed
it was dead, but lifting it up and removing
the fish I found the bird was all
right and ready for another. The head of
the fish was partly digested. I would not
suppose it possible for a Roseate Tern to
have captured or carried to land so large
a fish&mdash;much less such a little fellow attempt

carried out, being from <i>Turdid&aelig;</i> to <i>Tanagrid&aelig;</i>.
It is just the book for young ornithologists

<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">Technical Matters.</span></h2>
<p>Our ideas on technical terms are not
well understood by some of our readers.
We have the highest regard for advanced
scientists and closet naturalists, but as scientists
from education and force of habit
write only in their technical language,
which young naturalists cannot understand,
we have considered it a duty to our young
aspirants for ornithological knowledge to
publish bird life in plain English, always
giving scientific terms, but only once, after
that the English name only. We are in
perfect harmony with science. We are antagonistic
to nothing that is honest in nature.
We claim the right to express our
views when ornithological trash is placed
upon the market for our patrons to buy.
We are antagonistic to no other publication.
We claim the right to point out what
we believe to be errors, wherever found.
This is our platform and please remember
it, and don&rsquo;t forget that our readers are
hungry for every item of genuine news relating
to the life history of our birds, which
will be thankfully received; and whenever
possible take the name, both English and
scientific, direct from the check list. If any
other list but the Smithsonian is used give
the name, describe your observations carefully,
always bearing in mind that too
much dry science tends to rob a subject of
its general interest.</p>

<p>Our thanks are tendered to a friend who
kindly remembered us with two copies of
this work, which we have looked over as
carefully as our limited time would admit.
Our first search was for something new,
but we found it not; we turned to the
Snowy Owls, expecting that the author
would either prove or disprove Audubon&rsquo;s
story of shore birds at the Falls of the
Ohio, or at least have something to say
about it, but not a word. It would seem
to us that the author did not read the ornithological
literature of the day, did not
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
have any wide-awake correspondents in the
field, and had but a limited library of reference.
We are sorry that he has made
such poor use of the State&rsquo;s money, and
yet Doctor J. M. Wharton, the author,
states that it has been six years in preparation.
The time has been badly spent and
he has lost a golden opportunity of doing
a good work for the ornithologists of
America.</p>

which we had the pleasure of seeing
at the Academy of Natural Science. The
Wood Ducks are a beautiful group and
very life-like. Our readers will do well to

Dr. &ldquo;suggests the propriety of calling a
Congress of American Ornithologists to
discuss, vote upon, and decide each case in
which the Doctors disagree.&rdquo; We have no
room to discuss the question in this number,
but simply for the present to place it
on record, for it is a very important matter.
The Doctor compliments the O. and

<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">Ipswich Sparrows.</span></h2>
<p>On Nov. 21, &rsquo;82, I had occasion to go to
Ram Island Beach. This is a wide sandy
beach some fifty acres in extent, and covered
with beach grass, and in some parts
with bushes and small cedars. As I was
about to leave I saw several sparrows fly
up and alight on the cedars, and at the
first glance it struck me that they were
Ipswich Sparrows, and as if to convince
me a Song Sparrow flew up beside one of
them, showing off the large size and pale
tints of the former very markedly. Having
no gun I reluctantly left, but returned
in the afternoon, and after some hunting
secured all three of them. Two of them
measured 6&frac12; inches in length; the 3d 6 in.
Since then I have searched the beach over
carefully but found no more specimens of
<i>Passerculus princeps</i>. Saw flocks of Lesser
Redpolls on Dec. 5th and 6th.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Pine Finches</span> were abundant here in the

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">Capt. Chas. E. Bendire, U. S. A.</span></h2>
<p>Under date of Dec. 29th we have a long
letter from the Captain detailing many of
the duties at his new post, which seems so
far to quite fully occupy his time; so much
so that what spare time he does get is entirely
taken up collecting and making specimens,
so that instead of writing notes for
our readers, he is making them to be used
in the future. We will make a few extracts
from his letter such as will interest our
readers generally: &ldquo;However with all
the drawbacks I am making some headway
in my collection, and am getting some
good things. I have now catalogued 375
skins since my arrival here, and 300 of
these I have made since Sept 1st, besides
a great many alcoholic specimens not
counted in the above. We are having a
mild Winter, the snow is only about a foot
deep, when in other seasons it has been
three feet deep at this time. Birds are
scarce&mdash;about twenty species comprise the
more common Winter residents. The water
birds are too far off for me to trouble
them much&mdash;the nearest point on the lake
is ten miles. I had hoped to find some
rare Winter birds and plenty of them as
at Camp Harney in &rsquo;75 and &rsquo;76, but there
are very few, and even Owls and Hawks
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
are not near as plenty about the post here
as at Walla Walla. I presume the marshes
near the lake are full of them, but they are
almost impassible. When the lake and
marsh freeze over I expect a lot of birds
will be driven up toward the post, and by
that time very likely there will be so much
snow that I cannot get the birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been whispered among a few that
Captain Bendire was to take up American
Oology where the late Dr. Brewer left it,
and it is to be earnestly hoped that this
will be brought about at no distant day,
for the department can well afford to do it
as a very large edition would find a ready
sale if it was found necessary to sell it, as
the department now does the first volume,
besides being one of the very few capable
of undertaking this work. There was a
warm friendship between him and the
late Dr. Brewer that the death of the
latter has not in the least diminished
in the other. For the above reasons
Captain Bendire is the one above all others
to finish the work so well begun by his
friend the late lamented Dr. Brewer.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">Night Herons Breeding on the Marsh</span></h2>
<p>While collecting on the marsh I noticed
many Night Herons, and enquired of the
hunters and trappers if they found any
nests in the trees on the islands in the
marsh, but they did not, but had found the
nesting place on the marsh. I went for
them with a boy for guide. We rowed up
a channel as near the place as possible,
when they began to leave their nests in
the grass and rushes. When forty rods
off we left the boat and waded. The bogs
are a kind of floating sod, with two or
three feet of mud and water under them,
and sink at each step. The first nest was
in the rushes and built of rushes, about
one foot high and about the same width,
with just hollow enough to keep the eggs
from rolling out. Other nests were in the
grass, but most of them were in the cat
tail flags, in holes which had been burned
in the dry time. The nests in the flags
were built of pieces of flags, both leaves
and stalk. Those in the grass were built
of rushes and flags. The nests contained
from one to five eggs each, but
mostly three&mdash;two sets of five and a number
with four. I took about forty sets that
day&mdash;the larger sets were incubated, but
about half were fresh. I went a second
time to the marsh and got a lot of eggs.&mdash;<i>Delos

<p><span class="sc">Clapper Rails&rsquo; Eggs.</span>&mdash;During the season

These eggs were taken to sell for cooking
purposes in New York market.</p>

color with the exception of the head and
breast, which were a little more on the yellow
tint. It was with a flock of Redwing
Blackbirds. When I picked it up its eyes
shone like fire. The iris was of a fire red.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
